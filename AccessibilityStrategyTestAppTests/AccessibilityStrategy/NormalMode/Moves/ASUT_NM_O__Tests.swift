// O is a special move as it places the caret before the new linefeed
// it creates. i don't think it's possible with the AX API to not have to
// reposition the caret after pushing the new selectedText. therefore, unfortunately
// we have to call the ATEAdaptor from within the move. hence, tests have to be made
// in the UI Tests, as it's gonna modify the buffer. so most tests for O are there.
