// yes, only one test. i know you will want to add 32 other ones when you see that in 2 weeks

// 1. as stated above, here we only need to test the caret repositioning (D calls C, C is already tested)
// 2. the caret position will always go to the line endLimit, whether the line is empty or not. this is
// tested in the endLimit tests. so here we mostly have nothing to do. :D
// UPDATE: 2. is not valid anymore as ddgDollarSign may be passed the ScreenLine, in which case the caret position will not
// end up at the line endLimit, but will not move instead. that part is tested in ASUI dg$ test.
